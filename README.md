# FullStack-Website
My first full stack website utilizing HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Bootstrap etc. 

The site contains a homepage, a registration page, and animation page.
Users are able to sign up for my website, and the registration has a big form for users to fill in info
such as passwork, username, email, birthday, etc. 
this info is validated on the front end with JavaScript, before sent to the server side
then more validation is done on the server side with PHP. 
The site is mobile responseive with bootstrap and fron end done in HTML/CSS.
